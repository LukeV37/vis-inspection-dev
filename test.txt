This repository appears to be a machine learning project focused on image reconstruction using convolutional autoencoders. The core functionality revolves around preprocessing image data and training a convolutional autoencoder model to compress and reconstruct images. The project structure suggests a typical ML workflow with data preprocessing, model definition, and training components.

The main entry point of the project is the `main.py` file which serves as the primary execution script. It initializes the ConvAutoencoder model with a specified embedding dimension and sets up paths for dataset input and preprocessing output. The script likely orchestrates the entire pipeline from data loading to model training and evaluation.

The preprocessing functionality is contained within `preprocess/preprocessing.py`. This module handles loading image data from specified paths, applying rotational transformations to images, and managing the overall preprocessing pipeline. The preprocessing functions appear designed to augment the dataset by rotating images at various angles, which could improve the model's robustness to orientation variations in the input data.

The model architecture is defined in `train/model.py` with a comprehensive implementation of the convolutional autoencoder. It includes separate Encoder and Decoder classes that work together to compress images into a latent space representation and then reconstruct them. The model is designed to handle high-resolution images (1080x1920) and uses convolutional layers for encoding and transposed convolutional layers for decoding.

The training process is managed by `train/training.py` which contains the `do_training` function. This component likely handles the training loop, loss computation, and model optimization. The repository also includes setup scripts (`setup.sh`) and conda environment configuration (`conda/environment.yaml`) suggesting a reproducible development environment setup for the project.
